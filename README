This is the 2011 ICFP Programming Competition of team Celestial Dire Badger,
which is just me.  (I considered being "Rysorian Badger" this year, but, no.)

This is my table of submissions to the "unofficial" duel server,
lightly edited, in case anyone wants to know what I had when.
The latest (topmost) one is my final actual submission.
