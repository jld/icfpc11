"spell component": a string whose evaluation is pure
"basic spell": a string that evaluates to I and whose cdr is a component
"summon": allocate a slot for and evaluate

"prepare": decons a basic spell; summon its cdr and record its car/side
"cast": do the outermost app of a prepared spell; frees the summon cell
"imprint": represent casting as a basic spell by using get
  (the imprint should be cheaper to resummon than the original)

"persistent spell": a spell component that, applied, returns itself
"persist": convert a prepared spell into a persistent spell \
           with the same effect under the same casting

"complex spell": like a persistent spell, but changes itself (e.g., inc ctr)

"unbound spell": loops endlessly causing an effect
"unbind": convert a basic spell into its corresponding bound spell

###

Dynamic register allocation may be important.
  e.g., the cost of copying stuff to/from small numbers may be worth it
  Consider that a rectified literal costs 3n, but a copy costs n
    And literals can't always be eliminated
However, fast persistence requires hard-coding an index
